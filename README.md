# Arachnet
## Overview
Almost all websites load resources in the background,  such as images, scripts, but also tracking software.  Arachnet is an add-on for Mozilla Firefox, which clearly lists every access to such resources and in future will also offer the possibility to prevent and block the loading of third party resources.


## Installation Guide
- Run `npm install`
- Open Firefox browser
- Enter `about:debugging` in adress bar
- Select `This Firefox`
- Select `Load Temporary Add-on...`
- Navigate to the Arachnet project-folder and select the `manifest.json` file.
